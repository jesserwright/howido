# Chicken soup (my second example for 'mvp', before adding a database). Doing things that don't scale...

## Notes

- Costs $14 and makes about 8 servings
- You will need a good knife + cutting board, several bowls, and a pressure cooker. I am using the instant pot 6 quart
- Measurements are not exact - which makes prep go faster :)

  > Make sure the trivet is in there

- Add about 4 cups of water

  > Or 6 minutes per pound of (whole) chicken
- Open pot
- Move chicken into bowl
- Begin taking apart chicken, placing into another container
- Place chicken in refrigerator
- Remove trivet from pot
- Dump all bones into pot
