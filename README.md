Sorry there is not any setup documentation yet!

TODO: There should be environment variables for the development environment hardcoded.
TODO: `tem/` should not be a directory. That should be docker handled.

INFO: "How To" in source code is one word, never hyphenated and never camel cased. This is with the exception of the URI, which is `/how-to/[id]`

Q: How can "seed" data happen? Through a script of sorts? Maybe a node.js script via http? Or actix web client? (AWC). When does this run? Is it some sort of initialization script? Basically, it's nice to have data to work with, but it is for development purpuses only.
