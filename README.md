Todo

- Step create. 

What is this? Setting the environment to the user's environment?
#!/usr/bin/env bash

<!-- Idea for a copy-paste runnable server:
hardcode database permissions, but not port. Conditional compile then?
curl 'howido'
PORT=80 ./howido

Maybe this is a part of building excitment? I mean, I think it's pretty cool.

The caveat? Understanding memory and I/O! Also, cross compiling.. if there's gonna be 'releases'
